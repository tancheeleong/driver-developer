# driver-developer

Hi, I am a full-time driver as part of the gig economy in Singapore. I am not developing a "driver" program for self-driving cars. Just in case, my repo name "driver-developer" gives you the wrong idea. This blog is meant to document my journey from being a full-time driver to a competent developer.
