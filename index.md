Hi, I am a driver in Singapore, working 12-15 hours a day, everyday. I have been driving for almost eight years now, started with taxi and then now private-for-hire car. The point-to-point transport industry in Singapore has evolved ever since Uber gained prominence. The wide use of apps for getting a ride helps to map out the feasible pick-up/drop-off points in Singapore. Together with the push towards electric vehicles and support for trials of self-driving vehicles in Singapore, it is inevitable that self-driving taxi will be a reality within ten years. Hence, I cannot stand still, I need to prepare for what I want next.

### My Next Stage: Developer

I guess it is pretty obvious what is my desired next stage. So why do I want to be a developer? Isn't there already many well-established developers? And more are being groomed through the schools and self-learning. Developers will be so common and digitalisation of our work and life so pervasive that coding/programming skills will be required of anyone in the workforce. So I need to pick up relevant programming skills to stay in the game.

Additionally, I wish to be geographically free in my future endeavours. I reckon that developers have the best chances of getting such geographically-free jobs or businesses. I wish to be able to visit and stay any country at will without sacrificing income. 

Finally, it is the only prospect with a realistic possibility of self-learning and building up of portfolio while I continue putting in 12-15 hours of driving everyday.
