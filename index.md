Hi, I am a driver in Singapore, working 12-15 hours a day, everyday. I have been driving for almost eight years now, started with taxi and then now private-for-hire car. The point-to-point transport industry in Singapore has evolved ever since Uber gained prominence. The wide use of apps for getting a ride helps to map out the feasible pick-up/drop-off points in Singapore. Together with the push towards electric vehicles and support for trials of self-driving vehicles in Singapore, it is inevitable that self-driving taxi will be a reality within ten years. Hence, I cannot stand still, I need to prepare for what I want next.
